# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course
Welcome to this full Django Rest Framework (DRF)course. 
This course is perfect if you are looking to learn DRF and build your own API application.

## Prerequisites
- Python=>3.10

## Considerations
I have added optional docker containers to simplify the build. If you want to use the docker build you should install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.

We will be calling our API throughout the next 8 modules. I have written the requests in (Curl)[https://curl.se/] and (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/]. 

(Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] provides a clean terminal output which is handy for this type of project. You will need to install it locally if you want to use the commands.
>Note: (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] is pre-installed in the docker container.
